## Project Approach

The team employs a test-driven Scrum-based methodology, conducting regular sprints to drive the project forward. A backlog of user stories has been carefully analyzed, divided into tasks, and assigned estimated timelines. Collaborating with a product owner, the team prioritizes and incorporates these stories into each sprint.
Within each sprint, the team diligently executes the assigned tasks, undergoing thorough code reviews before merging their work. Regular meetings are conducted to facilitate progress sharing and obstacle resolution. As each sprint concludes, a meticulous review of the stories is undertaken to ensure completion or identify potential additional tasks. Additionally, a retrospective is conducted to gather feedback and enhance the development process.
